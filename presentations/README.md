## Presentations for COMM313 Group Project


### Initial_Project_Presentation.pdf

* This presentation gives an overview of our final project proposal. At this stage our primary research questions was "What are the primary attributes people look for in a romantic partner, and what habits do they form once they are in a relationship?". We used two data sources. One was private data from a professor at Penn and the other was a very large dataset from the Pew Research Center. We plan to conduct statistical tests on our data to find significant correlations as well as make graphs of the responses to survey questions.

* This presentation gives an overview of our final project. Our primary research question is "What do people look for in a relationship, and how do people behave when seeking/engaging in a relationship". Our secondary reserach questions were "What are the specific attributes people value more or less and how do these differ by varying demographics?", "What are the ways in which people interact through cell phones and social media when starting and ending relationships?", and "Do people feel like they can create meaningful bonds in their relationships through social media and cell phones?". We used two data sources. One was private data from a professor at Penn and the other was a very large dataset from the Pew Research Center. We found that heterosexual men tend to place relatively equal weight on superfical and substantive qualities whereas heterosexual women tend to value substantive qualities more than superficial qualities when determining their ideal partner. People prefer to start and break-up relationships in-person but use social media and texting to communicate with their partners on a daily basis. While people generally do not believe that social media or cell phones have significantly increased the meaningfulness of thier relationships they have experienced meaningful conversations through those platforms.
