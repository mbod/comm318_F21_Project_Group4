## Data analysis notebooks


* Data Analysis (Ce Liu) is a notebook that conducts analysis on the first dataset of the project. This is the shorter dataset that focuses on the attributes people seek for in an ideal partner.

* Data Analysis (Joy Ekasi-Otu) explores about 1/3 of the columns in dataset_2. The clean data is primarily comprised of demographic information and some question responses.
