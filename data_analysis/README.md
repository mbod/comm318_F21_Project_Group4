## Data analysis notebooks


* Data Analysis (Ce Liu) is a notebook that conducts analysis on the first dataset of the project. This is the shorter dataset that focuses on the attributes people seek for in an ideal partner. This analysis notebook looks at the general parameters of the dataset such as size and descriptive statistics of the general dataset.

* Data Analysis Part 2 (Ce Liu) goes beyond to find meaningful parts of the dataset to analyze. This analysis notebook focuses on finding significant statistical correlations between variables, subsetting variables into meaningful factors, and subsetting the dataset to under a certain age to match up with the teenage population surveyed in the other dataset.

* Data Analysis Part 3 (Ce Liu) puts analysis together from the past two notebooks and makes meaningful connections about the big picture meaning of the dataset. Using gender as a variable, this analysis looks at what quantitative metrics build an ideal man/woman in the hetereo-normative gaze.

* Data Analysis (Joy Ekasi-Otu) cleans about 1/3 of the data in Teen_Dating_Survey.csv and provides initial data analysis. The clean data consists of a section of the survey questions and demographic information.

* Data Analysis Part 2 (Joy Ekasi-Otu) conducts further data analysis on the cleaned data from 'Data Analysis (Joy Ekasi-Otu)'. 

* Data Analysis (Sofi de la Sierra) cleans another 1/3 of the Teen_Dating_Survey.csv and analyzes some of the results. This section focuses on finding the data behind how parents play a role in their child's relationship, how teenagers show interest in one another, how they ask each other out, their past online relationships, how they go about researching information about each other, how they spend their time together, if they share passwords, and how much their share about themsleves on social media.

* Data Analysis Part 2 (Sofi de la Sierra) conducts further data analysis on the cleaned data from 'Data Analysis'. It specifically looks at the most common way teens spend time with their significant other, the way they go about looking up information about their significant other, and the most common way to ask their significant other out.

*Data Analysis (Mason Parker) cleans another 1/3 of the Teen_Dating_Survey.csv and analyzes some of the results. This section focuses on how people interact and feel about their interactions through cell phones and social media, and whether or not the respondents are pleased with how they are able to communicate with others through cell phones and social media

* Data Analysis 2 (Mason Parker) further examines on the data from Data Analysis (Mason Parker) and dives into the dichotomies that respondents exhibit between how often they expect to hear from significant others through mobile devices and how often they believe they should be contributing to the relationship through these mediums, as well as between respondents not feeling that their relationships are stronger as a result of social media and cell phones, while simultaneously admitting that they have had meaningful conversations and discussions through texting, calling, and social media.

* Notes for Final Presentation is a plan for how we connect our two datasets together for the final blog post.
