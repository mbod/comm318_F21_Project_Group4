## Romantic Relationships in the Modern Age 

#### Project Overview:
What do people look for in their relationships? How do people behave when seeking/engaging in a relationship? These are the fundamental questions that drove this project, as Group 4 analyzed two separate datasets: one that assigned quantifiable values to attributes people desired in a romantic partner, and one that discussed adolescents' behavior through technology and social media in their relationships. Group 4 broke this question into three subquestions that were analyzed in the final presentation:

    1) What are the specific attributes people value more or less? How do these differ by demographics (gender, political orientation, etc.)?
    2) What are the ways in which people interact through cell phones and social media when starting and ending relationships?
    3) Do people feel like they can create meaningful bonds in their relationships through social media and cell phones?

We drew a number of conclusions from thorough analysis of these datasets as they related to the above questions. We hope you enjoy.

#### Content
* The "data" folder contains raw and clean data files, specifically relating to the attributes men and women most look for in a romantic partner and the role technology plays in the relationships of teenagers 
* The "data_analysis" folder contains notebooks documenting our data cleaning and data analyses. Judy cleaned the first dataset that catalogued the attributes for which people look, and Sofi, Joy, and Mason split the second dataset into three sections and each cleaned a third of it.
* The "final_data_story" folder contains our final project, where we discuss and analyze what attributes people value in a romantic partner, and how these desires differ between men, women, and other demographics, and also how technology impacts teenagers at the beginning, during, and at the end of their relationships, with ancillary discourse on the dichotomies that teenagers feel regarding appreciating and disliking social media being involved in how meaningful they believe their relationships to be.
* The "presentations" folder contains our intial and final project presentations that we delivered in class earlier this semseter.
